# travis-fpc

This is a simple repository meant to test building FPC only apps. All credits should go to the work done in the [nielsAD/travis-lazarus](https://github.com/nielsAD/travis-lazarus) repository.

The script in this repository is supposed to be able to compile FPC code on the following platforms;

- [X] Linux
- [X] OSX (Mojave, FPC 3.0.4)
- [ ] Windows (experimental)
